# Landing Page for Minecraft Server

This is a simple and stylized landing page for a Minecraft server, designed to be hosted for free on GitHub Pages.

## ðŸŽ¨ Features

- **Minecraft Theme**: Pixelated font, colors, and textures inspired by the game.
- **"Copy IP" Button**: Allows visitors to copy the server address in one click.
- **Fully Responsive**: Adapts perfectly to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Self-Contained**: A single `index.html` file, easy to modify and deploy.

## ðŸ”§ How to Use

1.  **Customize the Name**: Open `index.html` and replace all occurrences of `Your Minecraft Server` with your server's actual name.
2.  **Update the IP Address**: Find the line containing `<p id="server-ip" ...>` and replace `play.yourserver.com` with your real server IP.
3.  **Modify the Texts**: Adapt the descriptions in "The Server" and "Our Features" sections to match your server.
4.  **Change the Gallery Images**: Replace the `<div>` blocks in the "Server Gallery" section with your own `<img>` tags pointing to screenshots from your world.
